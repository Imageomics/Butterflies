# Understanding Mimicry in Butterflies from Images using Machine Learning

## Abstract

Quantifying variation in adaptive traits is essential for understanding evolutionary mechanisms such as mimicry in biology. Specifically, tropical Heliconius butterflies have bold wing patterns to warn off predators and have evolved by leveraging mimicry as a form of natural selection. In this work, we focus on taking a computational approach to modeling how butterflies perceive conspecifics, co-mimics, and other subspecies, and how they are perceived by external agents (birds, humans) using visual acuity measurements. We run a series of species classification experiments using image data of Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato mimic subspecies processed under different visual acuities.
